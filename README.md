ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sten Remmelg (@sremm)

ðŸ‘€ My biggest interests lie in the field of sports, health, performance optimization.
Within sports, anything that deals with acrobatics is of special interest. Currently I'm active as a coach and athlete in cheerleading.

When it comes to programming, I see it as an awesome tool, that helps make data useful.

My sharpest tools in my toolbox:
 - Using python to automate everything
 - Building machine learning models
 - Taking ideas from Zero to One.
